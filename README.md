# File Transfer using TCP and UDP in Python

## Overview
This project implements a simple file transfer system using both **TCP** and **UDP** protocols in Python. The TCP method ensures reliable file transfer, while the UDP method provides faster but less reliable transfer.

## Features
- ✅ **TCP File Transfer** (Reliable, ordered delivery)
- ⚡ **UDP File Transfer** (Faster but may have packet loss)
- 📂 **Supports any file type** (Text, images, etc.)
- 🖥 **Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface**
- 🔍 **Error handling for missing files**

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 🔗 Sockets (TCP & UDP)
- 🌐 Networking Basics

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system:
```sh
python3 --version
